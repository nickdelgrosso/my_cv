\SubHeading{Industry Experience}
\NewEntry{}{Technical Consultant}{UKT Psychosomatic Med. and Sports Med.}{I evaluated and designed a solution for performing medical science studies in a placebo study, and taught the PhD student who carried out the study over several remote sessions and a few travel consultations.}
\NewEntry{}{Research Internship}{The Neuromarketing Labs}{I completed set{-}up of an EEG laboratory, including software calibration and noise measurements. Designed and ran two experiments estimating the evoked responses of semantic agreement and price agreement, then analyzed the data. The results from the second experiment are the basis of Dr. M\textbackslash{}"\{u\}ller’s recently{-}published book, \textbackslash{}emph\{Neuropricing\}. Currently volunteering as an EEG consultant by giving one{-}day workshops on Fieldtrip, SPM, and artifact correction methods.}
