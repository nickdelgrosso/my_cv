This series was successful; it was regularly attended by 30{-}70 researchers.}%
\NewEntry{Fall 2017}{Organizer}{PyData Munich}{I revived a local chapter for the global PyData organization, coordinating with technology companies in Munich (e.g. Google, Nokia, TNG Consulting, JetBrains, and Wayra) to build a data{-}science teaching community through the MeetUp platform. These companies now host biweekly tutorials at their event spaces, sponsoring each event and providing spaces for university researchers and tech industry specialists to meet, interact, and learn together.}%
\NewEntry{October 2017}{3D Graphics Instructor}{Animal Tracking and VR Bootcamp}{I co{-}taught an international, week{-}long workshop on combining animal tracking through machine vision methods and 3D graphics applications to build virtual reality systems for freely{-}moving animals.
