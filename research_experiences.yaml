    Supervisor: Dr. Michael Barnett Cowan
    StartDate: Nov 2010
    EndDate: March 2011
    Description: Programmed an online EMG classifier in Matlab and Simulink to accurately detect finger movements within milliseconds for EEG coherence brain-computer interface training.
  - Institute: &instWitt Wittenberg University
    Supervisor: &supJo Prof. Dr. Josephine Wilson
    StartDate: Dec. 2009
    EndDate: Aug. 2010
    Description: Built an NI-DAQ EEG system, programmed online analysis and data acquisition in Matlab and LabView, and confirmed its functionality in three different experiments. As a senior lab assistant, also worked as an aid for rat neurosurgery and noninvasive electrophysiology (skin conductance, EMG, EKG, and EEG) laboratory course sessions, which included planning and giving demonstrations on each method above.
  - Institute: Duke University
    Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Jennifer Groh
    StartDate: June-Aug 2008
    EndDate: June-Aug 2009
    Description: Trained Macaque monkeys to perform visual saccade tasks while mapping receptive fields in superior and inferior colliculus.

    Supervisor: &supAnes Prof. Dr. Michael Anes
    StartDate: Aug 2007
    EndDate: Dec. 2009
    Description: Conducted three behavioral psychophysics studies on the hemispheric lateralization of face perception. Tasks included programming stimulus sequences in SuperLab, patient recruitment and management, data collection, and conference poster preparation.

    Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Jay Yoder
    StartDate: Nov 2006
    EndDate: March 2007
    Description: Measured dessication rates in the bed bug and isolated fungal growth in three species of cockroach. These studies resulted in a publication in a peer-reviewed journal and a poster presentation at an undergraduate research conference.

Industry Experience:
  - Position: Technical Consultant
    Institute: UKT Psychosomatic Med. and Sports Med.
    StartDate: April 2015
    EndDate: June 2015
    Description: I evaluated and designed a solution for performing medical science studies in a placebo study, and taught the PhD student who carried out the study over several remote sessions and a few travel consultations.
  - Position: Research Internship
    Institute: The Neuromarketing Labs
    StartDate: Nov 2012
    EndDate: Dec 2012
    Description: I completed set-up of an EEG laboratory, including software calibration and noise measurements. Designed and ran two experiments estimating the evoked responses of semantic agreement and price agreement, then analyzed the data. The results from the second experiment are the basis of Dr. M\"{u}ller’s recently-published book, \emph{Neuropricing}. Currently volunteering as an EEG consultant by giving one-day workshops on Fieldtrip, SPM, and artifact correction methods.
